To start implementaion of TS , Do these steps : 
1. npm init -y 
2. npm i --save-dev lite-server 
( We use lite server so we can't refresh our page every time. You must use this.)
3. I hope you make index.html and name.ts file till now.
4. npm start for development server start ,
5. type tsc name.ts every time in terminal to view changes.
6. That's it. 😁
